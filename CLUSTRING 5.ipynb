    "# extrinsic measure?\n",
    "# ANSWER In the context of machine learning, intrinsic and extrinsic measures are two types of evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of models. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic Measures\n",
    "Intrinsic measures are evaluation metrics that assess the quality of a machine learning model based on its internal performance and behavior, independent of any external tasks or applications. These measures are typically focused on the model's immediate outputs and often involve statistical or mathematical properties of the data or the model itself. Common examples of intrinsic measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.\n",
    "Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions (true positives + false positives).\n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives (true positives + false negatives).\n",
    "F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squares of the errors (the differences between predicted and actual values).\n",
    "Log-Loss: Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction input is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "Intrinsic measures are generally used during the development and training phase to tune the model's parameters and improve its performance based on the data it has been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extrinsic Measures\n",
    "Extrinsic measures, on the other hand, evaluate the performance of a machine learning model based on its effectiveness in a specific, real-world application or task. These measures assess how well the model contributes to the overall performance of a system when embedded in an end-to-end application. They often involve domain-specific criteria and are focused on the final utility of the model's predictions. Examples of extrinsic measures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task-specific Performance: For example, in a recommendation system, the extrinsic measure could be user satisfaction or engagement metrics (click-through rate, conversion rate).\n",
    "End-User Impact: How the model's predictions affect the user experience or business outcomes, such as increased revenue, reduced costs, or improved operational efficiency.\n",
    "A/B Testing Results: Comparing the performance of the system with and without the model in a real-world scenario to measure the model’s impact on key business metrics.\n",
    "Human Judgment: In applications like machine translation or summarization, human evaluators might assess the quality of the model’s outputs based on criteria like readability, relevance, or accuracy.\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "Focus:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic measures focus on the internal performance metrics directly related to the model's output.\n",
    "Extrinsic measures focus on the external impact of the model when integrated into a larger system or application.\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic measures are often context-independent and purely mathematical or statistical.\n",
    "Extrinsic measures are highly context-dependent, considering the specific application and end-user experience.\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic measures are used primarily during the model development and evaluation phase to fine-tune and validate the model.\n",
    "Extrinsic measures are used to assess the real-world effectiveness and utility of the model in practical scenarios.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intrinsic: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, MSE, Log-Loss.\n",
    "Extrinsic: User engagement metrics, business impact metrics, task-specific success rates, human evaluation scores.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Both intrinsic and extrinsic measures are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models. Intrinsic measures help ensure the model is technically sound and performs well on the data it was trained on, while extrinsic measures ensure that the model provides real value and effectiveness in its intended application. Balancing both types of evaluations helps in building robust and practical machine learning solutions.\n"
